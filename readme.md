# WDD 130 - Web Fundamentals

This repository contains all of the code written in class this semester, in addition to other code that may be helpful.

This repo contains 2 branches:

- [section-01](https://github.com/nathanbirch/wdd130-spr22/tree/section-01) - this will be code written in the WDD130-01 section (10:15-11:15 on Mondays and Wednesdays).
- [section-02](https://github.com/nathanbirch/wdd130-spr22/tree/section-02) - this will be code written in the WDD130-02 section (11:30-12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays).

Throughout the semester, Brother Birch will push to this repository so you can always have access to the code written in class.
